# Biquads
* lowpass
* highpass
* bandpass
* notch
* peak
* lowshelf
* highshelf

# Type of Biquad
* Direct Form I
* Direct Form II (I think this is the kind Kfr implements)
* Transposed Direct Form I/II

# Cascaded Biquads
* up to 4 sections
* 
# IIR Filters
* Z,P,K
* SOS
* Bessel
* Butterworth
* Chebyshev I&II

# FIR Filters
* designer
* taps and window
* lowpass
* highpass
* bandpass

# DFT
* DFT
* DCT 

# Windows
* alot of window functions available
* as expression or a univector

# Convolution
* Convolutional Filters
* Correlation
* Autocorrelation

# Samples
* Sample Rate Converter
* Sample conversion 

# math
* univector 
* randoms
* ebu 128
* dB 
* hertz 

# Matrix
* Armadillo
* Eigen

# Matlab
* alot of matlab expressions are easy to figure out with Lua and uKfr
